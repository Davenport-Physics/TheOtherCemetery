        \subsection{Funeral Home}

            ``Moving here was supposed to be a change of pace for my family. 
            However, I never anticipated that it would mean this \ldots
            \\

            I wanted to thank all of you for being here. Most of you
            don't know Duncan, but I am sure he would have appreciated it'' - Anna

        \subsection{Henry's Bedroom}

            ``Hey Bud, how are you doing?'' - Anna
            \\

            ``\ldots'' - Henry
            \\

            ``Yeah, me too. I miss them.'' - Anna says with some pause between each word spoken
            \\

            ``Well \ldots try to get some sleep tonight alright? You have to get back to school tomorrow'' - Anna
            \\

            ``Love you kiddo'' - Anna
            \\

	\section{Day One}

        \subsection{Henry's Bedroom}

            The player is now given control over Henry's movements. They are free to explore the tiny room and at some point
            they should make their way to the lobby of the home. Upon entering the lobby, he is greeted by his mother who is
            currently making some food in the kitchen.

            ``Hey, did you sleep well?'' - Anna
            \\

            ``\ldots'' - Henry
            \\

            ``Well either way, I made you some lunch. Don't forget to take it'' - Anna
            \\

            ``And try to have a good day today, okay? I know \ldots it's hard, but we'll get through this.'' - Anna

        \subsection{City}

            After the player has a conversation with their mother, they are free to leave home and explore the world. They are
            expected to go to school, however given the open world nature of this area, they might encouter some non-linear elements in the
            world.

            On this day, and this day alone, the city will be relatively busy. There will be people walking around, going into and out of buildings and school children
            playing and walking to school.

        \subsection{School}

            Upon entering the school, there will be no children in the halls. It'll seem empty at first glance. Henry will walk down the hallway and enter 
            his classroom which is literally at the end of the hall. He would have ran partially late, a school bell ringing just before he had even entered the building.

            The teacher, ignorant or indifferent about Henry's predicament, will make a snide comment to him.
            \\

            ``Why are you late?'' - Substitute
            \\

            ``\ldots'' - Henry
            \\

            ``Nevermind, I don't care. Just, go find a seat immediately.'' - Substitute
            \\

            ``Now, everyone please open up you notebooks and take out a pencil\ldots'' - Substitute
            \\

            The screen will fade to black and after a few moments it'll fade back in. The class is over and the player is free to explore
            the school a little bit. The classroom is small and is similar to your typical american film depiction. The hall way outside of the classroom
            is filled with students. Each student facing inwards, and covering both walls. They don't move and they don't make a noise. You're only option
            as henry is to guide him to the end of the hallway, towards the entrace you came through.

            Once you arrive close to the entrance, a school boy walks up behind you and punches you in the back of the head, triggering an event where you attempt
            to run away from your attacker.

        \subsection{City After School}

            If you were successful in running away or fending off your attacker, you'll be able to explore the city. It'll be empty but it will still be daytime. You'll hear wind blowing, but
            it may as well be inaudible.

            From here you are able to explore the town a little bit further. Some parts of the forest possibly opened up, revealing a new path. Possibly a ceremony area where people are
            conducting a ritual. You of course won't witness it, but you'll be able to see some remnants of it.

            You'll be expected to walk home. Nothing else will happen until then.

        \subsection{Home}

            If you were successful in running away or fending off your attacker, your character will not have scratches or bruises. Something Henry's mother would surely notice
            when you get home. It will also remain daytime.
            \\

            ``Hey! Did you have a good day at school?'' - Anna
            \\

            ``It\dots was okay.'' - Henry
            \\

            ``Well that's good to hear.'' - Anna
            \\

            ``I had a fairly weird day myself. I went to the grocery store to get some food and after I was done, I didn't see a single soul.'' - Anna
            \\

            ``It's like everyone decided to go home all of a sudden.'' - Anna
            \\

            \textbf{Alternatively}, if you are unsuccessful in running away or fending off your attacker, Henry will have 
            scratches and bruises on his person and it'll be night time. Henry's mother will immediately notice and ask what happened.
            \\

            ``Hey! Where have you\ldots Honey what happened to your face?!'' - Anna
            \\

            ``\ldots'' - Henry
            \\

            ``Henry, tell me what happened.'' - Anna
            \\

            ``I'm fine okay!'' - Henry
            \\

            ``\ldots'' - Anna
            \\

            ``Well, go get cleaned up. And we are not done here mister.'' - Anna
