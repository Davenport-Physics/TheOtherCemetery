    \subsection{Henry Saves The World}
    
    \paragraph{Description} Similar to Galaga or Missile Command, the player will be represented as Henry. A horde of aliens is trying to land on earth, and it's your job to stop them. Using rockets and an 	assortment of weapons, you attempt to get a high score.
    
    \paragraph{Gameplay} Enemies will appear from the top of the screen and move downwards semi randomly. Henry will be facing upwards. High scores will be persistent across loading
    and saving.
